Designing an eCommerce product page using HTML and CSS involves creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that effectively showcases products to potential customers. The HTML structure provides the content and layout, such as product images, descriptions, prices, and add-to-cart buttons, while CSS enhances the design with styles for fonts, colors, spacing, and responsive layouts. A well-designed product page aims to highlight the product's features, build trust with customers, and encourage conversions by making the shopping experience intuitive and engaging.
